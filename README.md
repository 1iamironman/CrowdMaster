# CrowdMaster
__If you are a python coder and want to help, send me an email [here] (mailto:johnroper100@gmail.com) and tell me what you can do. I would be glad to have your help.__

Blender crowd simulation addon inspired by the BlenderPeople script and Pter Noble's Inaite. Just run the add-on like you would with any other add-on in Blender. You can find the menus in the Node Editor inside the CrowdMaster node tree. Documentation is being worked on and will be found in the wiki when done.

## About the old code:
The old code is from the BlenderPeople addon for Blender 2.42 by Harkyman.
I have included it as reference in the hope that we can possibly learn a bit from it.
Most of the code is not usable because Blender 2.4 used a bgl-based UI and the old mesh and animation systems.
