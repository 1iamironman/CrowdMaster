# CrowdMaster
Blender Crowd Simulation Addon

## Installing required modules
1. Make sure you are using Python 3.5 or greater
2. Install pip
3. Install *pymysql* using `pip install pymysql`(on some systems you may need administrator permissions)

## About the old code:
The old code is from the original BlenderPeople addon for Blender 2.42 by Harkyman
I have included it as reference in the hope that we can possibly learn a bit from it.
Most of the code is not usable because Blender 2.4 used a bgl-based UI and the old mesh and animation systems.
