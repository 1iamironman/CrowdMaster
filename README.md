# CrowdMaster
Blender crowd simulation addon inspired by the BlenderPeople script. To install, follow the steps below to install the required python modules and then run the add-on like you would with any other add-on in Blender.

## Installing required modules
1. Make sure you are using Python 3.5 or greater
2. Install [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Install *pymysql* using `pip install pymysql` (on some systems you may need administrator permissions)

## About the old code:
The old code is from the BlenderPeople addon for Blender 2.42 by Harkyman.
I have included it as reference in the hope that we can possibly learn a bit from it.
Most of the code is not usable because Blender 2.4 used a bgl-based UI and the old mesh and animation systems.
